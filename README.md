Concept:

We're building Wanderlust AI, a revolutionary trip planning tool that goes beyond just recommendations. Imagine a conversational concierge service that plans your entire trip through a chat interface!

How We're Different:

While giants like Tripadvisor offer user reviews and booking options, we take it a step further. It's all about personalization and convenience.

The Wanderlust AI Advantage:

Chat First: Forget clunky menus and endless browsing. Tell us your dream vacation through a chat interface, just like texting with a friend.
Personalized to You: We don't just suggest random destinations. We get to know you, your preferences, and your travel style to craft the perfect itinerary.
One-Click Booking: Found the perfect hotel or activity? Book it right there within the chat, no need to jump through hoops.
Think of Devin as the architect building the "chat room" for Wanderlust AI. Here's what they need to focus on for the front-end:

Conversational Interface: Design a user-friendly chat window where users can interact with the AI travel assistant.
Engaging & Informative: Make the chat engaging and informative, using visuals and clear prompts to guide users through the conversation.
Seamless Booking Integration: Ensure a seamless booking experience within the chat. Users should be able to book flights, hotels, and activities with just a click.
